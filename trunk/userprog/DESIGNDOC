---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.

Our implementation of wait involves adding to the thread struct a
condition variable and lock, a list of
dynamically allocated process_child_status structures, a parent
pointer to the process parent, and a process_child_status pointer directly
to the to the parent's list element of the current process. 

The condition variable and lock allows for signalling between a child and 
a parent so a parent does not have to busy wait on a child in the wait 
function. The process_child_status structures
are used to store persistent information about a child to the parent that
created it. This information includes a process ID of the child process, a
process_status enum for specifying the state of the child process
(starting, started, failed, done), the return value of the child process
(only valid when process_status is failed or done) and a struct list_elem to
enable the structure to be included in the child list of it's creator. The
additional process_child_status pointer allows a thread to have direct
access to it's parents list element of the process_child_status
corresponding to the current child process. We added this for optimization reasons so there
were not unnecessary traversals through lists of child processes when a
thread wanted to update information about it's own process_child_status.

Upon process termination, a global process_dying lock is acquired to avoid
race conditions of competing process terminations then the process's
personal process_child_status is updated to reflect the final exit code
and process_status. The terminating process is then free to signal it's
parent's lock to release potential waits. The thread can now remove itself as usual
since it's exit status is safe in the persistent process_child_status
element of it's parent.


>> B6: Any access to user program memory at a user-specified address
>> can fail due to a bad pointer value.  Such accesses must cause the
>> process to be terminated.  System calls are fraught with such
>> accesses, e.g. a "write" system call requires reading the system
>> call number from the user stack, then each of the call's three
>> arguments, then an arbitrary amount of user memory, and any of
>> these can fail at any point.  This poses a design and
>> error-handling problem: how do you best avoid obscuring the primary
>> function of code in a morass of error-handling?  Furthermore, when
>> an error is detected, how do you ensure that all temporarily
>> allocated resources (locks, buffers, etc.) are freed?  In a few
>> paragraphs, describe the strategy or strategies you adopted for
>> managing these issues.  Give an example.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you
>> ensure proper synchronization and avoid race conditions when P
>> calls wait(C) before C exits?  After C exits?  How do you ensure
>> that all resources are freed in each case?  How about when P
>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are
>> there any special cases?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

      	     SURVEY QUESTIONS
	     ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
